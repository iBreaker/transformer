# 👽 Not Only a Translator
[English](./README.md)|[中文](./REDAME-zh.md)

This program is not just a translation software, it is not named yet. Supports conversion of input characters to another character, including various types of codecs. Packages different types of converters into plug-ins to easily enable users to use them on demand.

Under development, no stable version. The first official version will be released in `v1.0.0`, so stay tuned.
